What goes into this file?

- Place original layout designs (.gds or .oas) with PCell contents here. (i.e., keep check the box "Store Pcell and Library context information" checked). This is helpful in the future if we want to reference these layouts and redesign them
- Scripts that were used to generate your layouts (if any).
- Slides/document that describes your designs, objectives, testing plans, and any other helpful information that helps future designers.
