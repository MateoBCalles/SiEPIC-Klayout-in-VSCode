# KLayout VSCode Examples

This repository demonstrates how to use KLayout with Visual Studio Code (VS Code) for faster layout development, especially useful for UBC layout workflows.

**Why VSCode?**

* **Speed:** Faster than KLayout's built-in macro editor.
* **Better Editing:** Syntax highlighting, code completion, and more.
* **Integration:** Works well with Git and other tools.
